# 🌤️ Weather2Mood: CNN-Based Music & Recipe Recommender

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify weather conditions from images, maps them to corresponding emotions, and recommends a fitting song and recipe. It combines computer vision, emotion modeling, and content-based recommendation into a seamless pipeline.

## 🧠 Methodology

1. **Weather Classification:** A custom CNN model is trained using labeled weather images to classify input images into weather types like "lightning," "fog," or "rain."
2. **Emotion Mapping:** Each weather label is mapped to a unique emotion (e.g., "fogsmog" → "edgy", "lightning" → "intense").
3. **Recommendation Engine:** Given the predicted emotion, the system recommends:
   - A song from the Spotify dataset based on mood tags and audio features.
   - A recipe from RecipeNLG dataset based on mood and ingredient profile.

## 📊 Figures and How They Were Created

### 🎨 `results/sample_output.png`

**Description:** Shows the end-to-end output: predicted weather, mapped emotion, a song recommendation, and a recipe with ingredients.

- **Generated by:** `generate_output_figure()` in [`visualize.py`](./visualize.py)
- **Weather Prediction:** `predict_weather_and_emotion()` in [`predict.py`](./predict.py)
- **Recommendation Engine:** `get_recommendations()` in [`recommender.py`](./recommender.py)
